# build-binaries.sh — cross-compile pf-cli for one GOOS/GOARCH, inject the
# release version from the git tag, and write the stripped binary to
# dist/pf-cli-<goos>-<goarch>. Called once per matrix axis by the build-binaries
# CI tool, which supplies the Go SDK (b19/go image, or host go on a prefer-local
# run). core is a pinned module, so its SPDX texts arrive in the module zip —
# nothing to fetch before the build.

# The v1 schema is a //go:embed input, so it must exist before the compile. This
# job cannot take it from the fetch-schema artifact: `artifact:` hands off ONE
# artifact PER MATRIX CELL, and fetch-schema carries no matrix, so a cell here
# would look for a name that was never uploaded. The script is idempotent and
# costs about a second, so this job fetches its own copy.

# Version resolution, portable across planes: the forge runner exports the tag as
# $GITHUB_REF_NAME (forwarded via the build-binaries tool's env: list); the make
# plane has neither an arg nor that env, so fall back to a git-derived / dev version.
# Keeps a local build honestly stamped, mirroring m6e-version.sh (tag → short sha → dev).
